As many people may already know, George R. R. Martin's The Known World, is perilous world; 74 of our beloved (and not so) characters have died. Between white walkers, direwolves, the faceless god, the lord of light, dragons, wars, sacrifices and weddings, the odds are not good.

Death, though bountiful, is not entirely unpredictable. If you are planning a trip to The Known World, either for business or pleasure (I hear the beaches of Dorne are amazing). 

---


We created an algorithm to predict your chances of surviving your trip.

---


For example: If you are 25 year old female, whose last name is Smith and who has no children, no intention to attend a wedding while there and no intention to start a war, your chances of survival are 74 percent.

On the other hand, if you are a 65 year old male, whose last name is Baratheon, you have particpated in wars, you have many children and you have attended weddings, your chances of survival are 4 percent.
